# RealMuruGame

MuruGame (5.2021 - 7.2021)

This is my first solo project in webgl format.
Done by my classmate (graphic artist) Tatu Uusitalo

Code made my me, all graphical elements made by Tatu.

Idea of this project was to make a fun little game for Restaurant Muru's website. It purpose is to be something fun/funny and also 
a different kind of platform to add some advertisement on website.

If our first group project teached me how to be part of team, this in other hand teached what it takes to make a game by your self (or in really small "team").

This project also teached me a bit about that how to work with real customers, what it means to listen what customers want and what they dont want.

My part is finnished and now it only needs one web-address from client. After that it can be but live on their site.

At this point it can be found from itch.io under username tunixxx78.
